gutenprint (5.2.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  The CUPS "canon" and "epson" backends are obsolete in Gutenprint 5.2,
  and have been removed by the upstream developers.  Users of these
  backends need to migrate their print queues to use the standard
  backends such as "usb", "parallel" and "socket", which now contain the
  functionality of the old backends.  The package postinst script will
  attempt to automatically upgrade your print queues to use the
  appropriate backend, but the queues should be checked to make sure
  that the correct backend has been selected.

  In particular, USB printers will require the print queue to be
  modified to use the correct IEEE-1284 device ID.  The device IDs
  for the USB printers currently connected to the system may be viewed
  by running

    /usr/lib/cups/backend/usb

  or for all printers with

    lpinfo -v

  and set with

    lpadmin -p PRINTER -v 'usb://DEVICE-ID'

  Alternatively, this may be done using the CUPS web interface by browsing to

    https://localhost:631/printers

  and then choosing "Modify Printer" for each printer in question.
  The available printers will be shown in a list.
